# Project progress

This folder tracks completed work, verification, blockers, and the remaining CS2 vision imitation-learning milestones.

**Last updated: 2026-09-07. Current milestone: local settings protection passed; online Steam verification remains.**

The protected renderer produced a two-second clip, exited cleanly, and left all
39 selected personal settings files unchanged. An initial shutdown bug was fixed,
and all 17 historical renderer staging folders were archived out of CS2. See
[the settings workflow and evidence](../WINDOWS_RENDERING.md#keeping-normal-play-separate).
Steam Offline Mode was subsequently reported by the user; online Cloud and
reconnection behavior are not yet verified.

The project retains **4,933,316 reconstructed commands**. Its latest three-player campaign has **480 frames and 960 aligned commands**, all passing pixel matching and exact first-person POV checks. Sample acceptance now reports explicit rejection reasons. **Zero samples are accepted yet** because execution/observation timing remains unverified, with additional local quality issues. Pause and ammo extraction are corrected, and Dust2 has been re-extracted into a new directory. No model has been trained.

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Current status](STATUS.md) | Everything built, what works, what is only partly verified, and where the artifacts live |
| [Next steps](NEXT_STEPS.md) | Ordered work items with dependencies and completion criteria |
| [Completion history](CHANGELOG.md) | Dated record of delivered work, checks, and decisions |
| [Validation guide](../VALIDATION.md) | Native POV/action checks and the remaining clock evidence |
| [Acceptance guide](../ACCEPTANCE.md) | Temporal sample rules, manifests and campaign summaries |

The [project handoff](../../CS2_Vision_Imitation_Learning_Project_Handoff.md) remains the specification. Use the [Windows workflow](../WINDOWS_RENDERING.md), [phase filtering](../PHASES.md), [HUD profile](../HUD_PROFILE.md), and [alignment guide](../ALIGNMENT.md) for current commands and evidence. [The repository README](../../README.md) has setup examples; the [initial run report](../INITIAL_RUN.md) preserves earlier parser results.

## Keeping this up to date

After a meaningful implementation or verification milestone:

1. Update `STATUS.md` to describe the current behavior and its evidence.
2. Check off completed items in `NEXT_STEPS.md`; record what proves they are complete.
3. Add a dated entry to `CHANGELOG.md` with changed components, checks, output locations, and unresolved issues.
4. Record new parser/schema/normalizer/renderer versions when they change. Keep earlier history and raw artifacts intact.

Use **implemented**, **verified on real demos**, **verified with synthetic fixtures**, **blocked**, and **not implemented** precisely. A passing unit test or renderer dry run does not prove a complete replay-to-training-data run.
